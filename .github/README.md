# Mariani

## Introduction

Mariani is a native macOS UI for [AppleWin](https://github.com/AppleWin/AppleWin), by way of [Andrea](https://github.com/audetto)'s [Raspberry Pi port](https://github.com/audetto/AppleWin).

But if what you want is a macOS command-line app, you can build that too with the [instructions below](https://github.com/sh95014/AppleWin#build-sa2).

### Features

- Native, universal macOS UI
- Screen recording
- Copy screenshot to pasteboard
- Disk image browser, including syntax-highlighted listings for Applesoft and Integer BASIC, as well as hex viewer for other file types
- Floppy and hard disk image creation
- Full-screen support
- [Debugger](/source/frontends/mariani/debugger/README.md) and memory viewer (including a live viewer for the current BASIC program!) in separate windows
- [AppleScript](/source/frontends/mariani/scripting/README.md) support
- Numeric keypad joystick emulation

Mariani should now be broadly useful, so please [report any issues](https://github.com/sh95014/AppleWin/issues) you run into.

### Roadmap

Experimental support for printers is available in a [branch](https://github.com/sh95014/AppleWin/tree/printer-support). It needs considerable [upstream support](https://github.com/AppleWin/AppleWin/issues/1026) and is unmaintained.

## Build Mariani

### Dependencies

The easiest way to build Mariani is to satisfy the dependencies using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh). After you install Homebrew, pick up the required packages below:

```
brew install libslirp
```

Note that the default branch for Mariani is `macos`, not `master`. This is so that the `master` branch can be kept clean for individual contributions upstream.

### Checkout

Now grab the source code:

```
git clone https://github.com/sh95014/AppleWin.git --recursive
```

Load up the Xcode project, make sure you select the "Mariani" scheme, and then target for "My Mac".

"Mariani Universal" is the target used to build a universal (x86 and ARM) app, and will *not* build out of the box. Homebrew does not support universal libraries, so you'll have to follow [these instructions](https://medium.com/mkdir-awesome/how-to-install-x86-64-homebrew-packages-on-apple-m1-macbook-54ba295230f) on an Apple Silicon Mac to install the x86 versions of the relevant libraries. Here's a handy script to combine them into universal shared libraries:

```
#!/bin/sh

lipo -create -arch arm64 /opt/homebrew/lib/$1 -arch x86_64 /usr/local/homebrew/lib/$1 -output $1
```

You'll need to run that script for everything that the "StaticWrapper Universal" target needs to link against, which are currently `libintl.a`, `libglib-2.0.a`, and `libslirp.a`. The Xcode project expects them to be placed in `../universal/` relative to itself but you can change that to your liking.

## Build sa2

sa2 is the binary produced by Andrea's port. It's not the focus of this repository but it's a more "faithful" AppleWin and very useful to compare behaviors and bugs.

### Dependencies

sa2 needs more external libraries than Mariani, which you can grab for macOS using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh). After you install Homebrew, pick up the required packages below:

```
brew install cmake pkgconfig libyaml minizip libslirp libpcap sdl2 sdl2_image
```

### Checkout

Next, you'll probably want to generate an Xcode project to take advantage of source code indexing and finding the lines of code with warnings or errors. The parameters assume you just want the imgui frontend:

```
git clone https://github.com/sh95014/AppleWin.git --recursive
cd AppleWin
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE -DBUILD_SA2=ON -G Xcode ..
open applewin.xcodeproj
```

The project should now launch in Xcode. Select the `ALL_BUILD` target and build. You can look under `Products` in the left pane to see where it is, because unfortunately Xcode does not seem to be able to run and debug the binary directly.

Or, you can follow basically the same instructions as in [Linux](linux.md), but in this case also simplified to build only the sa2 frontend:

```
git clone https://github.com/sh95014/AppleWin.git --recursive
cd AppleWin
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE -DBUILD_SA2=ON ..
make
```

Note that some of the settings (most of the ones stored in `~/.applewin/applewin.conf`) will affect both Mariani and sa2.
